Today we're continuing [OverTheWire's Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} wargame.&lt;!--more--&gt; So let's go to [natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org](http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} and log in with the password we found last time. 

This time they disabled right clicking but we can still go to the Developer Tools on your web browser. 
On Chrome, go to View / Developer / View Source. On Firefox, it's Tools / Web Developer / Page Source.

That's it for level 1, **keep hacking and have a great day !**

This is my first post and I'm really happy to get started. &lt;!--more--&gt;

Today I'm going to progress in [OverTheWire's Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} wargame which teaches us the basics of serverside web-security.
To get started, just visit [natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org](http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}. The username and password for level 0 are natas0.

The goal of this wargame is to retrieve the password for the next level by exploring the site, finding vulnerabilities and exploiting them.

This first level is quite easy since we just have to view the source code to get the password.

That's it for level 0, **keep hacking and have a great day !**
