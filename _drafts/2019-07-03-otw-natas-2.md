Hi everyone !<br>
Let's keep going with [OverTheWire's Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) wargame.  <!--more-->

Inspecting the source code of [natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org](http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org) we find an image tag with the source attribute of value */files/pixel.png*. So there's a */files* directory at the root of the website.

Visiting */files*, we get an interesting file called *users.txt* which contains the password for level 3.

So that's it for level 3, **keep hacking and have a great day !**
