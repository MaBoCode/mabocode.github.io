Good morning everyone !<br>
Continuing with [OverTheWire's Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) wargame.<!--more-->

There's something new to learn today about web development. Web site owners can choose to add a */robots.txt* file in their site. This file is used to give instructions to web robots. 

You can visit [this site](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) to get more information about it.

The *robots.txt* file informs us that there's a */s3cr3t* directory. Visiting it we see a *users.txt* as in the previous level where we can find the password for level 4 !

That's it for level 4, **keep hacking and have a great day !**
