Good morning everyone !<br>
Today we're continuing [OverTheWire's Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) wargame.<!--more--> So let's go to [natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org](http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org) and log in with the password we found last time. 

This time they disabled right clicking but we can still go to the Developer Tools on your web browser. 
On Chrome, go to View / Developer / View Source. On Firefox, it's Tools / Web Developer / Page Source.

That's it for level 1, **keep hacking and have a great day !**
