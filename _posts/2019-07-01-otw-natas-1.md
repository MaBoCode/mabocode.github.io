Continuing [OverTheWire Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/){:target="_blank"} wargame.<!--more--> Let's go to [natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org](http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org){:target="_blank"} and log in with the password we just found. 

This time they disabled right clicking but we can still go to the Developer Tools on your web browser. 
On Chrome, go to `View / Developer / View Source`. On Firefox, it's `Tools / Web Developer / Page Source`.
