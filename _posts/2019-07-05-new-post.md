You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight c linenos%}

/* add.c
     * a simple C program
     */
      
    #include <stdio.h>
    #define LAST 10
      
    int main()
    {
        int i, sum = 0;
       
        for ( i = 1; i <= LAST; i++ ) {
          sum += i;
        } /*-for-*/
        printf("sum = %d\n", sum);

        return 0;
    }

{% endhighlight  %}
