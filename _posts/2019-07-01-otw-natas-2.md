Hi everyone !<br>
Let's keep going with [OverTheWire's Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/){:target="_blank"} wargame.  <!--more-->

Inspecting the source code of [natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org](http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org){:target="_blank"} we find an image tag with the source attribute of value `/files/pixel.png`. So there's a `/files` directory at the root of the website.

Visiting `/files`, we get an interesting file called `users.txt` which contains the password for level 3.

That's it for this level, **keep hacking and have a great day !**
